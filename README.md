### Repositories

I have a lot of repositories, I know. This guide will help you easily navigate through my projects, which are organized into three main categories: University Projects, Practice Projects, and Interview Projects. Each category follows a consistent naming convention to help you identify the type of project and its specific focus.

#### University Projects

All university-related projects are organized under the following naming convention:

```bash
university-[subject]-[name]
```

`[subject]` - The subject or course related to the project (e.g., izp, ipp, ids, isu, isa, ipk) <br />
`[name]` - A brief descriptive name of the project

#### Practice Projects

Practice projects were developed to improve my skills in specific technologies or concepts. They follow this naming convention:

```bash
practice-[technology]-[name]
```

`[technology]` - The primary technology or tool used in the project (e.g., angular, java) <br />
`[name]` - A brief descriptive name of the project

#### Interview Projects

Projects completed as part of interview processes are categorized using this convention:
```bash
practice-[technology]-[name]
```

`[company]` - The name of the company for which the project was created <br />
`[name]` - A brief descriptive name of the project
